  \section{Introduction}
  In this project we tackled the problem of predicting the ratings for
  movies, which can be helpful for recommender systems by recommending movies of high predicted ratings by a user to him. Formally, given a set of $n$ users and $k$ movies and an
  incomplete rating matrix $U$ of $n$ by $k$ entries, our task is to predict the
  missing entries of $U$. The prediction is made possible with a large
  set of training data, consisting the incomplete rating of other $m$
  users for the same set of $k$ movies.

  There are multiple ways to solve this problem. The algorithm we are
  using is collaborative filtering, which takes the idea from $kth$
  nearest neighbor search (KNN). Given a user and the movie whose
  rating we want to predict, we first find similar users in the
  training set that have the ratings on this movie, then predict the
  unknown rating from these known ratings. The core of the algorithm is
  to find similar users with the testing user in the training
  set. Given the scale of the problem, we implemented our algorithm
  with MapReduce and execute it on the real cloud platform.
\section {Motivation}
Recommender Systems are used in diverse applications such as: Amazon or online markets for recommending products to customer that they may be interested in buying, social networks in form of recommending friends or pages, recommending restaurants or hotels and recommending movies for users to watch by Netflix, which is our project application.

Recommender systems are significant since companies can improve their sales using accurate recommender systems. Additionally, using recommender systems enhances customer satisfaction especially when he/she feels that the recommendations made by the system match their taste or needs to a great extent. Accordingly, both customers and companies would got some benefit from using recommender systems.

This project works on a subset of Netflix challenge dataset, which is a real dataset for a big data application. So we were interested in applying big data tools such as: Spark for preprocessing data analysis and Java Map Reduce for the main algorithm on a real cluster environment to solve such a real interesting big data application.
