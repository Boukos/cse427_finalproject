\section{Implementation}
Our algorithm consists of two major stages: the first stage is finding
the most similar movies for each movie in the test set based on their
overlapping ratings and the second stage is predicting the
corresponding missing entries of the ratings matrix $U$ for pairs in
the test set.

For the first stage, we have implemented it using three map reduce
jobs:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Job1: This job works on the training set, it produces
  movie-movie pairs and their ratings by each user.

  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
      \hline
      Mapper Input & ($movie_i$,$user_k$,$rate_{ik}$) triplets\\
      \hline
      Mapper Output & ($user_k$,($movie_i$,$rate_ik$))\\
      \hline
      Reducer Input & ($user_k$,[($movie_1$,$rate_1k$),..($movie_i$,$rate_ik$),...]), all movies rated by user k along with their rates\\
      \hline
      Reducer Output & ($movie_i$,$movie_j$),($rate_{jk}$,$rate_{jk}$), all pairs of movies rated by user k and their rates\\
      \hline
  \end{tabular}
  
\item Job2: This job works on the first job's output, the job mainly
  calculates cosine similarity between every pair of movies provided
  in the first job's output using their overlapped ratings.

  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    Mapper Input & ($movie_i$,$movie_j$),($rate_{ik}$,$rate_{jk}$), rated pairs by user k.\\
    \hline
    Mapper Output & ($movie_i$,$movie_j$),($rate_{ik}$,$rate_{jk}$) (It is Identity Mapper)\\
    \hline
    Reducer Input & ($movie_i$,$movie_j$),[($rate_{i1}$,$rate_{j1}$),($rate_{i2}$,$rate_{j2}$),...($rate_{ik}$,$rate_{jk}$)])\\
    \hline
    Reducer Output & ($movie_i$,$movie_j$),$cos(movie_i,movie_j)$\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  
\item Job3: After calculating similarity between each movie pairs, the
  third job selects the top-k similar movies for each movie. The
  default $K$ we use is 10, however, we can pass K as an input
  parameter using command line.

  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    Mapper Input & (($movie_i$,$movie_j$),$cos(movie_i,movie_j)$\\
    \hline
    Mapper Output & ($movie_i$,($movie_j,cos(movie_i,movie_j)$)\\
    \hline
    Reducer Input & ($movie_i,[(movie_j,cos(movie_i,movie_j))\ldots]$), list of all overlapped movies with $movie_i$and their corresponding rates\\
    \hline
    Reducer Output & $(movie_i,[(movie_j,cos(movie_i,movie_j))\ldots])$, Top-K similar movies per movie \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{itemize}

For the second stage, since the top-K entries per movie is a small
number, this task does not require a Map Reduce job. Accordingly, we
have implemented it using Python.
